Add to that custom, inhouse designed lightning and parallax effects, along with a dedicated awesome Soundtrack and original storyline, we hope you will enjoy your stay!\n",

      "Welcome to the Omni-Care sanctioned city. The world as we know it has come to an end and a New Order has taken over. Life is seemingly perfect, in an almost utopian society humans have to officialy schedule their whole days in advance via \"ports\" - mandatory cybernetic implants. Large commercial entities who also happen to be port manufacturers have replaced governments and crime is practically non existent. You are the hero of this exciting cyberpunk tale, about to start a regular day, only for it to unfold in the most unexpected manner revealing the true nature of the multi-layered city.\n",

      "-A unique, carefully planned out story and lore: It is important to remember that you are thrown into a world of specific rules, laws, customs, lingo, social segregation etc which you will learn and unravel in time along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Old school gameplay: meaning little to no handholding. We wanted to give the player the choice of freedom and to discover and unravel the story at their own pace, hence Sinless offers little to no handholding. Therefore many features or lore related backstories/explanations are not thrown in your face. Instead they are somewhere in the world, waiting to be discovered; be it a feature, easter-egg/game reference, or world news event etc. But fear not, optional hints highlighting interactive points will be available from the get-go.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Hand crafted with love: Thousands of frames of hand crafted animations, graphics,textures and other assets. We put a lot of effort and attention to the lore and story as well as the general vibe- that the graphics and soundtrack complement themselves to create the desired tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "-A fitting and engaging dynamic Original Soundtrack by Roland Redwood, designed and tailored specifically for the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Game Over: when we said \"old school\" experience we were dead serious. You will die...alot. Well, maybe not that much as in the Souls series, but unless you are a point n' click pro, an unexpected end to your journey will be commonplace. Heck, we even took it a level further where discovering all possible endgames is a feature and accomplishment within itself. Luckily there's a checkpoint system which will take you back to the last safe point. And fear not, we left it at that (so no trolling in the vein of which some old school classics are notorious for ie AITD where you could break a mandatory quest item at the very begining of the game)... but we never can be sure of what the future may bring... ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "-Easter egss & references. Yup, we got that covered. Sinless is a love letter to classic games,systems and news, both old and new. Rise of the Dragon, Dredd (2013), Deus Ex, Dark Souls, Sleeping Dogs.... the list goes on and on. Will you find them all?\n",

Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.\n",

Flip upside-down to avoid holes, surf on top of the Octagon—whatever you can do to survive the mad race through this trippy 8-sided tunnel. An energizing soundtrack by Sqeepo and psychedelic color bursts keep you in the zone on your race to the finish. But with each round over after just 60 seconds, only super-fast reflexes will beat this very challenging game. \n",

You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap.

      "- Parental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your child.\n",
      "- YouTube Kids contains paid ads in order to offer the app for free. Your child may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.  For more information, please check out our Parental Guide.\n",
      "- Videos in the app are selected by our automated systems. Please note, no system is perfect, and it is possible that your child may find something you don’t want them to watch.  If your child finds a video that you feel is inappropriate, please flag the video and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.\n",
      "- You can restrict your child’s experience by turning search off in the set-up flow or by accessing the settings behind the “grown-ups only” lock. This means your child can’t search for content, which reduces the chances that they will encounter a video you don’t want them to watch. \n",
      "- Whether search is on or off, the app will recommend videos selected by our automated systems from the broad set of videos accessible in YouTube Kids.\n",

TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n",

      "A: Though time is continuous, for rapid tracking, we separate time into blocks by half/quarter an hour at the expense of accuracy. This period not only meets the need of statistics, but also is convenient for people to remember event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Why make 30/15 minutes a block? This is not accurate.\n",
      "A: Statistics is meaningful only when people persist for a long time. Look at statistics in week or month, 30/15 minutes a blocks hardly make negative effects on analysis. Compared to spending more energy to make it accurate, track time quicker, take advantage of saved time on other things makes it better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: I have OCD, inaccuracy makes me uncomfortable.\n",
      "A: Just stand back and think about it, if you pursue the accuracy, after every time of record, should you add an event called \"Tracking time\"? Then it takes some time to track this one, so you have to record again, and then, endless loop…\n",

      "Montessori Letter Sounds is a multi award-winning app to get your children on the road to reading!\n",
      "\n",
      "It works in 4 easy steps:\n",
      "- From the age of 3: “I spy” to play sound games.\n",
      "- Around 4 years old: “Letter sounds” to memorize the letter sounds and shape.\n",
      "- Between 4 and 5: “Mix and match” to bring together the two first steps.\n",
      "- Around 4 1/2 years old: “Sound it out” to write their first words using a moveable alphabet.\n",
      "\n",
      "All four steps are included in this version but two games are locked at first and get unlocked as the children play and win marbles.  This ensures progressive learning.\n",

      "The settings offer:\n",
      "- Script, Cursive or Capital letters\n",
      "- *Our unique \"foreign language\" option, which enables children to play with the letter sounds in one of the four languages while listening to the instructions in their native language.\n",

      "Children also benefit from a “Toolbox” offering:\n",
      "- A phonetic alphabet \n",
      "- A notebook\n",
      "- A sandbox to trace letters freely \n",
      "- An image box (great for vocabulary)\n",

      "This version includes English, Spanish, French, German and Italian with a unique \"foreign language\" option to start learning another language!\n",
      "\n",
      "In each step, children will find a learning activity and a game to help them put their learning into practice.  Self-correction is encouraged throughout the app to increase self-confidence.   The system keeps track of marbles won by each player.  Marbles are used to unlock games and levels and to stimulate learning.\n",
